# MLS-Project
Machine Learning &amp; Statistics Project for 2019

## Assignment Instructions
Using one Jupyter notebook;
1. Conduct an analysis of the Boston House Price data using descriptive statistics & plots. (20%).
2. Use inferential statistics to analyse if there is a significant difference between the median house prices between those along the charles river and those that are not. (20%).
3. Create a neural network that can predict the median house price based on the other variables. (60%).

## Initial Approach
1. Research to see what is written about the Boston House Prices dataset.
2. Gather credible external sources for reference and write a small literature review.
3. Conduct my own analysis of the Boston House Prices dataset.
4. Using ANOVA determine if there is a significant difference in median house prices between properties along the Charles river and those that are located elsewhere.
5. Utilise external sources to help the discussion.
6. Create initial neural network to predict the median house price based on the other varibales.
7. Compare the predictions to the expected values in the original dataset.
8. Utilse my own analysis of the Boston House Prices dataset to train and tune the neural network.
9. Compare the enhanced predictions to the expected values in the original dataset.
10. Draw balanced conclusions.
